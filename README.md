<h1>Y10-IT-Assignment</h1>

<p>Holds my IT projects for my S2 Machine Learning Assignment</p>

<p>This assignment has 4 Projects demonstrating my knowledge of machine learning, through various mediums, largely including written code and an essay.</p>

<h2>Projects Overview</h2>

<h3>1. Forest Fires Assignment</h3>

<p>The forest fires assignment allowed me to demonstrate linear regression in Jupyter and the pandas function. I had difficulties translating the code from the grade predictor, yet after a while, I was able to complete the task.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>11th of August</strong> - Began the assignment, structured the code, and started running algorithms based on the grade predictor task.</li>
  <li><strong>12th of August</strong> - Achieved accurate results after entering data, visualized it in a table, and started working on a line graph visualization in Jupyter.</li>
  <li><strong>18th of August</strong> - Finished the task with the line graph showing extremely accurate results.</li>
  <li><strong>22nd of August</strong> - Completed adding comments to all the code, ensuring it was understandable for someone with a basic knowledge of Jupyter/Python.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. KNN Model Assignment</h3>

<p>This project allowed me to demonstrate my ability to evaluate and create tables and arrays that can accurately predict data. I had trouble with creating the algorithm which would allow me to display the data.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>13th of August</strong> - Began working on the framework of the assignment in class, received helpful information from my friends on how to tackle it.</li>
  <li><strong>16th of August</strong> - Completed the task in class with the help of my peers and teacher. I had problems getting an accurate result in the array, yet after changing a variable, the problem was resolved.</li>
  <li><strong>20th of August</strong> - Finished the assignment, made the notes readable for someone with base-level knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. K-Means Clustering</h3>

<p>This assignment allowed me to demonstrate the skill of cluster graphs through Python and the generative ability of machine learning. I used the example of plant types and clustered them depending on ground type and plant type. I had minimal difficulties with the assignment.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>25th of August</strong> - Began and successfully completed the assignment in class, adding every relevant note needed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Essay</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>11th August</strong> - Began essay, made a plan for it.</li>
  <li><strong>15th August</strong> - Completed my essay in full at home.</li>
  <li><strong>17th of August</strong> - Proofread my essay for punctuation and spelling mistakes.</li>
</ul>
